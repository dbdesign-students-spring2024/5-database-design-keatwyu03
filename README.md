# Data Normalization and Entity-Relationship Diagramming

## Entity - Relationship Diagram
I thought it would be useful to start drawing out the entity relationship diagram, as it would later allow us to directly change all tables in to fourth normal form (with the corresponding attributes).

The process of converting this massive non-normalized table into fourth normal form started with me drawing out the Entity Relationship Diagram. I needed to see what nouns we were interested in (assignment, student, due date, professor, assignment topic, classroom, grade, relevant reading, and professor email) and whether they fell into the category of an attribute or an entity (depending on if we needed other entities to link to them). Butm there was a missing link of the section and courses entities that would draw the whole diagram together, so I started with the `Section` entity. I found that all the related entites would have a direct link with `Section`. Then I identified the cardinality between each entity. 

For example, I decided that one professor can teach many sections, but one section can only be taught by one professor.
One classroom can host many sections of classes, but each section can only be taught in one classroom. 
There are many sections for each course, but every section can only be of one course. 
One professor can assign many assignments, but one assignment can only be assigned by one professor (can be to different sections)
Hence all of the relationships above are one-to-many.

One section can be assigned many assignments, and one assignment can be assigned to many instructions.
One student can complete many assignments, and one student is completed by many assignments.
Finally, one student can be in many sections, and one section can hold many students. 
Hence all of the relationships above are many-to-many. 

Note: The relationship between professor and assignments can be negleted because we can access the professor and assignment table through the section table. However, if we would like to directly access the assignment table from professor, then it is easier to have that direct link.

Note: If we decide not to store any information about the attributes of a course, we can choose to make it an attribute of `Section`, but I am expecting a university to have some attributes that would be useful to describe a course. So I decided to make it an entity, but it really can be an attribute of `Section` if we were not interested in the details of `Course`. 



## Fourth Normal Form Compliant Tables

Original Table of the students' grades in courses at a university (already in first normal form)

### Reasons that don't make the table above Compliant to 4NF
(In order to be compliant to fourth normal form, the table needs to be compliant to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal forms).

First normal form is already satisfied via the presentation of the original table. 

Firstly, in order to be compliant to second normal form, all attributes must directly belong to the entity identified by the composite key of assignment_id and student_id. Hence in this table, the only attribute that does depend on the composite key (if we denote the composite key of this table to be `assignment_id` and `student_id`) is the attribute ` grades`. We need to know the `student_id` and `assignment_id` in order to find the grade associated to a student from a given assignment. The other attributes do not depend on the composite key, so this fails second normal form.

Secondly, the table fails third normal form because fails to comply with second normal form. In addition, the `professor email` attribute does not depend on any part of the composite key or the composite key as a whole. Rather, the `professor email` attribute depends completely on the `professor` attribute. Hence this does not satisfy third normal form.

The table does not comply to fourth normal form because the second and third normal forms are not compliant. 

### Tables in 4NF

| 3 | Nevarez | i.nevarez@foo.edu | 
|...|...|...|

This table conforms to 1NF because there is a fixed schema and there is only one value per field per record.
This table conforms to 2NF because all the attributes describe the primary key `Professor ID` (and there are no composite key so 2ND cannot fail)
